React Movie Explorer with Search and Pagination

This project is a comprehensive movie information app built using React and Axios. It fetches data from a public API, seamlessly displaying details about a wide variety of movies. The core functionality includes an efficient search feature that allows users to find specific movies with ease, and pagination to browse through the extensive movie database smoothly.

The application has been designed with a responsive layout, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across devices, from desktops to mobile screens. Emphasis was placed on creating an intuitive and fluid user interface, offering users a delightful browsing experience.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in React for building dynamic, data-driven web applications and showcases my ability to integrate APIs efficiently. By focusing on performance, usability, and clean design, I aimed to strike a balance between technical depth and user-friendliness.
